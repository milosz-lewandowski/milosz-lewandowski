### Hi, I'm Miłosz `MeWash` Lewandowski 

`Java Backend Dev since 2018` 

---
I started my journey with `Java 8`, transitioned briefly through `Java 8 EE` & `Java 11`, gained solid professional experience on `Java 17`, and today I work fluently with `Java 21` & `JavaFX 21`. I’m comfortable with features like `concurrency`, `JPMS`, `streams`, `functional interfaces`, and more. 

Recently I’ve rediscovered the robustness of **desktop** applications, which inspired my latest cross-platform `JavaFX` project on GitHub: `ContentPocket`.

Beyond pure Java my *main expertise* lies in **backend** systems - mostly `REST APIs`, usually `Microservices`/`MVC` backed by `Spring Boot`, `Data JPA`/`Hibernate`, Relational DBs (`Postgres`, `Oracle`, `MySQL)`, containers (`Docker`/`Kubernetes`), built with `Gradle`/`Maven`.

Throughout my career I’ve also *come across*, **testing** frameworks (`JUnit`, `Mockito`), **frontend** technologies (from `JSP`/`Thymeleaf` to `React`), `Spring Security` with `JWT` and messaging systems (`RabbitMQ`, `Kafka`). For persistence beyond `Hibernate` I’ve used `MyBatis`, raw `JDBC`, and `PL/SQL`.

Outside professional work (not fluent in this area yet), I’ve *experimented with* **mobile** development using `Kotlin` and `Jetpack Compose` for `Android`, I’m also *interested in* **wearables** and plan to explore personal projects there in the future.

I thrive in international, remote-first teams, communicate fluently in English, and balance independence with teamwork. My approach combines creativity with pragmatic problem-solving, always with a focus on learning and delivering quality software.

Finally, I am truly concerned about `software security`. While I’m still building practical and theoretical expertise, I try to make it a point to evaluate risks, anticipate threats, and do my best to apply secure practices in every project I work on.
