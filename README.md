### Hi, I'm Miłosz  Lewandowski 

`Java Backend Dev since 2018` 

---
I started my journey with `Java 8`, transitioned briefly through `Java EE 8` & `Java 11`, gained solid professional experience on `Java 17`, and today I work fluently with `Java 21` & `JavaFX 21`. I’m comfortable with coding approach that leverages features like `concurrency`, `JPMS`, `streams`, `functional interfaces`, and more. 

Recently I’ve rediscovered how lightweight, fast, and robust **desktop applications** are, which inspired my latest cross-platform `JavaFX` project on GitHub: `ContentPocket`.

Beyond pure Java my *main expertise* lies in **backend systems** - mostly `REST APIs`, usually `modular (microservice-ready) monoliths` or `distributed microservices` backed by `Spring Boot`, `Data JPA`/`Hibernate`, Relational DBs (`Postgres`, `Oracle`, `MySQL`), containers (`Docker`/`Kubernetes`), built with `Gradle`/`Maven`.

Throughout my career I’ve also *worked with*, **testing frameworks** (`JUnit`, `Mockito`), **frontend technologies** (from `JSP`/`Thymeleaf` to `React`), `Spring Security` with `JWT` and messaging systems (`RabbitMQ`, `Kafka`). For persistence beyond `Hibernate` I’ve *had a chance to work with* `MyBatis`, raw `JDBC`, and `PL/SQL`.

Outside professional work, I’ve *experimented with* **mobile development** (not fluent in this area yet) using `Kotlin` and `Jetpack Compose` for `Android`. I’m also interested in **wearable devices** and already have few ideas for personal projects in that area.

I thrive in international, remote-first teams, communicate fluently in English, and balance independence with teamwork. My approach combines creativity with pragmatic problem-solving, always with a focus on learning and delivering high quality software.

Finally, I am truly concerned about **software security**. While I’m still building practical and theoretical expertise, I make it a point to evaluate risks, anticipate threats, and do my best to apply secure practices in every project I work on.

If you're wondering how to pronounce my name, reading it as `"Me-Wash"` does the job ;)
